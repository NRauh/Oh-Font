#Oh Font (v0.3)
Oh is an icon font of arcs of various lengths and styles.
It was created to be a free and open source font that to show progress radially, when circular graphics aren't available. Of course, you can use it however you'd like.

##Characters
A full demonstration of Oh, and character numbers can be found [here.](https://NRauh.github.io/Oh-Font)
More styles will probably be added, so if you have an interest in Oh, check later to see.

Currently, Oh has a thick outline of a hollow circle, which uses the characters `.`, `a-z`, `A-Y`, with `Z` being an outline of the edges.

There's also a full circle that resembles a pie chart. This is at the (unicode) character spaces u+00A1 to u+00D5, with the last one being a circle outline.

##Contributing
If you want to make a style, feel free to do so and submit a pull request.
If you would like a new style implemented but don't want to mess around with creating the font, then open an issue on GitHub and if it's sensible then it could get added.
If you do that, then it does help if you make at least the design (i.e., SVG, EPS, etc.).

`letter.svg` is a circle that is the correct size, to help with design.

Since the idea is to show progress, the progression of your design must be consistent.

Existing characters must stay where they are.
The encoding should be ISO 10646 (unicode), so there's enough room to not need to move them.
